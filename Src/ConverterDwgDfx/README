Build Instructions:

Make sure you have autoconf, swig, texinfo, python-dev, build-essential packages
or equivalent installed via your package manager.

cd libredwg
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install
cd ../dxflib
./configure && make && sudo make install
cd ..

Once the above dependencies have been built, edit /usr/local/include/dwg.h,
and rename the THICKNESS constant (or add _ to end). It conflicts with another
constant included in the converter, but is not used itself. After that, just
run "make".

That's it!
